    .SYNOPSIS
        This script is used to build the Vincent OS Kernel manually.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The script build the Vincent OS Kernel manually for distributions that
        are not based on Arch Linux or if, and only if, you really have
        problems to build with Arch Build System.
    
    .PARAMETER -Help
        Show the help message.
    
    .PARAMETER -NoRust
        Do not build the Rust part. Only for debugging purposes.
    
    .PARAMETER -Check
        Check if all tools are installed.
    
    .NOTES
        I know some of you gonna hate me for doing this but I feel funny to
        add PowerShell script to Vincent OS (and because I deliver PowerShell
        package in the installation).
